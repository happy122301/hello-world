Hi everyone

I am so happy to take the course in HU. I have a MS in Marketing fron NYU. I used to work in an education company as a market development director. But my job had nothing to do with marketing, and I'm not that interested in the education area. So I quit my job to study Analytics. I want to make a career change to be a Data Analyst in the future.
